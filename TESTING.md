## Automated Testing 

Automated tests were ran using the Jest framework. I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of Jest tests would be more comprehensive.

### Game Base Jest Tests
To see the tests that were conducted please refer to [??.test.js](??.test.js).
